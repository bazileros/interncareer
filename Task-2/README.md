Task 2: SQL Database Design and Optimization
Description:
Design a database schema, optimize queries, and
explore performance tuning techniques using
SQL.

1. Database Design:

- Design a normalized database schema for a given scenario, focusing on table
  structures, relationships, and constraints.
- Implement primary keys, foreign keys, and appropriate indexing.

2. Query Optimization:

- Write and optimize SQL queries to ensure efficient data retrieval.
- Analyze query execution plans, identify bottlenecks, and refactor queries for
  better performance.

3. Indexing and Tuning:

- Implement indexing strategies to improve query performance.
- Explore techniques like clustered and non-clustered indexes, covering indexes,
  and index hints.

4. Normalization and Denormalization:

- Understand the concepts of normalization and denormalization and apply
  them appropriately in database design.
- Evaluate trade-offs between normalization levels for performance and data
  integrity.

5. Performance Monitoring:

- Use SQL profiling tools to monitor database performance.
- Identify and resolve issues related to locking, blocking, or slow queries.
